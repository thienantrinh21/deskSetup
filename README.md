# deskSetup
This desk set up gives a minimalist vibe that I strive for in my desk organization. Assembly includes: Desk, iMac, keyboard, trackpad, and lamp.


I utilized different features of SolidWorks such as Swept Base, Extruded Base, Extruded Cut, Linear Pattern, and Fillet in creating this assembly.
